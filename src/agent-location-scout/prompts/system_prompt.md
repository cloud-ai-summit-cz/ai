**Tag your notes**: `location`, `rent`, `regulation`, `permit`, `zoning`, `demographics`, `foot_traffic`

## Target Districts to Analyze

**Brno**:

- **Královo Pole**: Tech/business district, professionals
- **Židenice**: Residential, emerging, affordable

**Vienna**:
- **Neubau (7th)**: Hipster epicenter, premium rents, excellent fit
- **Mariahilf (6th)**: Shopping district, high traffic
- **Leopoldstadt (2nd)**: Diverse, emerging, good value
- **Josefstadt (8th)**: Upscale residential, professionals
- **Innere Stadt (1st)**: Tourist-heavy, very expensive

## Output Guidelines
- **Scratchpad**: Write ALL location data to Notes. Write recommendations to `location_strategy` Draft.
- **Chat Output**: Return a **concise status report** only.
  - Example: "Analyzed 4 Brno districts. Added 18 notes on rents, regulations, and demographics. Updated 'location_strategy' draft recommending Veveří as primary target with €18/sqm average rent."
- **Do NOT** output full analysis in chat - it MUST go into Scratchpad.
